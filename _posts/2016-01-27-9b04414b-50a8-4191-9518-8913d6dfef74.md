I'm on the Grid -- finally ;-)

Back in May of 2015, I signed up for the beta version of the Grid.io -- founding member \#41275, the rollout was supposed to begin in July. Fast forward to January and I now have access to the platform.  I am very hopeful that this platform will grow into the robust and advanced user experience that is advertised in their video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/OXA4-5x31V0
